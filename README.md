# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is based on the Kaggle competition: [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

## 📌 Objective
Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with machine learning basics.

## 📓 Notebook Overview
The notebook `model.ipynb` includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Model Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluation and Submission File Generation

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Upload the Titanic dataset to your Kaggle notebook (via the "Add Data" option).
2. Run all cells in `model.ipynb`.
3. A submission file (`submission.csv`) will be generated.

## 📂 Dataset
Make sure the dataset files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, etc.) are in the path:
